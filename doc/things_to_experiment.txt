[] 3d/4d matmul tests
[] conv layer tests
[] pool layer tests




MARK PARAMETERS AS PARAMETERS!!! AND ADJUST ONLY THEM!!! And save only them, and output how many you have in the model
    but there's also constants. so basically everything that is a result of a computation, you can't change/set their values! from the outside. and shouldn't be stored of course. views too.

add convolutions and see if that helps to learn it faster
different optimizers
    learn adam

different activation functions
manually driving lr etc. lr schedules
different batch sizes
different weight initializations

architecture changes

different number of layers

different number of neurons per layer

learn softmax etc. all the tricks





try language modeling finally


different architecture: sdrs | trees | somehow voting etc.

better load/save
make compatible with ggml/tinygrad
